# FEND Feed Reader Testing Project

In this project, I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds included [Jasmine 2.1.2](https://jasmine.github.io/2.1/introduction) library. The project started with one test suite, and I need to finish all required tests for the project.


## How to run the app

1. Download this repository to your pc.
2. Open index.html
3. If all tests passed, the Jasmine section at the bottom of the page will show green as shown below:
![Alt Text](/jasmine_pass.png?raw=true "screenshot for passing tests")
4. If there is a test failed, the Jasmine section will show red.

## Required Tests

RSS Feeds:

* Test that the Feeds are defined
* Test that the Feeds has defined URL and URL is not empty
* Test that the Feeds has defined name and name is not empty

The Menu:

* Test the slide menu is hidden by default
* Test the menu changes visibility on click

Initial Entries:

* Test that when first loaded the feed, the initial entries have at least single entry

New Feed Selection:

* Test that when a new feed is loaded, the content actually changes.
